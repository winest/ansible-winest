## About ansible-winest

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a great tool to deploy your software and configs
to various machines under different environments. And this is my personal scripts to
setup development environment.



### Main features:
- Wrap all frequently-used tasks to different roles.
- Support install to system or user's personal directory.
- Won't download the same file twice if it's already exist on target directory.
- Easy to update software to new version, just replace files under roles/xxx/files.
